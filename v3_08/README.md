# ArcGIS JavaScript API Examples

## Library version 3.8

This is a simple example of setting up a simple map application, by creating a map and adding a few layers. This and other pages using previous versions of the API are available for testing purposes.

- [Basic Map](http://raykendo.github.io/ArcGIS_JSAPI_Examples/v3_08/index.html) - A simple world map loading a tiled and dynamic map service.
- [Compact Map](http://raykendo.github.io/ArcGIS_JSAPI_Examples/v3_08/compact.html) - The same map as above, but loading using the "Compact" edition for mobile apps.

## Big changes from previous version
  
 The big change for this version was support for IE11. Previous versions would not scroll to zoom correctly on the desktop, and wouldn't scale correctly on a Windows tablet running IE11.

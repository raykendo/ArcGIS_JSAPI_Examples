# ArcGIS JavaScript API Examples

## Library version 3.6

This is a simple example of setting up a simple map application, by creating a map and adding a few layers. This and other pages using previous versions of the API are available for testing purposes.

- [Basic Map](http://raykendo.github.io/ArcGIS_JSAPI_Examples/v3_06/index.html) - A simple world map loading a tiled and dynamic map service.
- [Compact Map](http://raykendo.github.io/ArcGIS_JSAPI_Examples/v3_06/compact.html) - The same map as above, but loading using the "Compact" edition for mobile apps.

## Big changes from previous version
  
- JavaScript library hosting CDN moved to js.arcgis.com
- All classes in the API supporting dojo/on events instead of dojo/connect

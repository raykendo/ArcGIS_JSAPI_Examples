# ArcGIS JavaScript API Examples

## Library version 3.7

This is a simple example of setting up a simple map application, by creating a map and adding a few layers. This and other pages using previous versions of the API are available for testing purposes.

- [Basic Map](http://raykendo.github.io/ArcGIS_JSAPI_Examples/v3_07/index.html) - A simple world map loading a tiled and dynamic map service.
- [Compact Map](http://raykendo.github.io/ArcGIS_JSAPI_Examples/v3_07/compact.html) - The same map as above, but loading using the "Compact" edition for mobile apps.
